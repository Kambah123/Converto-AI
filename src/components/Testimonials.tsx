      <h1>Case Study: Australian Real Estate Agency</h1>
      <h2>Problem:</h2>
      <p>A multi-location real estate agency was losing leads because his team rarely followed up with prospects who inquired through calls or visited their website. Many hot leads went cold due to lack of communication. They also had no data on which properties were getting the most attention.</p>
      <h2>Solution Implemented:</h2>
      <p>Deployed a voice agent to handle all property inquiry calls, answer FAQs, and collect caller preferences. A chatbot was added to their website and Facebook page for 24/7 engagement. Every inquiry was logged, and automated follow-up messages were triggered. The AI also analysed conversations to determine which property types were getting the most traction.</p>
      <h2>Results:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Missed leads dropped by <strong>95%</strong>.</li>
        <li>Conversion from lead to site visit jumped by <strong>60%</strong>.</li>

        <li>Focused promotions on trending properties led to <strong>22%</strong> higher ROI on ads.</li>
